# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* 

## Product
* 

## Process
* Our plan didn't go accordingly to the way we expected it to, so we planned to change our goal of the game to make it best fit for us
* Our MVP:
Player movement
Enemies
Attack animation
* Beyond MVP:
Health bar
Death screen
Score
Code snippets of:
Health bar
Attack
Enemies following you and attacking you
Our main struggle was the GitHub collaboration and pulling/pushing 
## Conclusion
* 

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
