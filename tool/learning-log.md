# Tool Learning Log

## Tool: **Godot**

## Project: **Open World Game**

### 9/30/2024: (Getting the gist of Godot)
* For my freedom Project I want to create a game using the tool of Godot
* Starting with the [website](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/introduction_to_godot.html), I read the introduction
* Godot has this community tutorial and resources for additional help and support --> [website](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/community/tutorials.html#doc-community-tutorials)
* Godot also has this screen which makes it organized and a lot like GitHub and Photoshop
* Godot has a component called Nodes
* Nodes are used to store things in the "tree"
* The tree is called a "scene tree" where it stores all the scenes in one place
* There is also a thing called signals that are used to change the code inside the tree. This is very useful and also flexible for some quick changes.

### 10/14/2024:
* This week I want to start looking at tutorials and I found two videos to take notes on
* Tutorial [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKgTZWbwD1U&t=10s)
* I learned more about how Godot engine develops games
* Godot has a feature where you can alternate shapes to different sizes called Collision shapes
* Collision shapes are an amazing feature because you can adjust size by using your mouse
* There's also a thing called a Gizmo and it is there to make the shape adjustable for all sizes
* Mesh Instance is when you can make any shape 3d and also realistic with lighting
* The second [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntYjl_obUDo&list=PL9FzW-m48fn1iR6WL4mjXtGi8P4TaPIAp) shows me in a slower pace of what the first scene of Godot should look like
* Godot doesn't necessarily need code for a beginning scene, Godot can be used by dragging the mouse and creating new components.
* Godot feels a lot like HTML and CSS but more interactive instead of typing code
* Godot does have the option to write restrictions towards the game but at the moment I would be focusing on how the platform works

### 10/21/2024:
* This week I am just going to go through this [document](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/learning_new_features.html)
* This is called a user manual and it highlights the engine concepts
* There's a way to search up concepts as well using `F1` or searching up `Help`
* [This](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/index.html#doc-class-reference) is all the classes page
* This reference also tells you the class role and what goes through what  
For example: PhysicsBody2D --> Collision2D --> Node2D 
* There is also a community page where when people need help you can always ask for help
* I also wanted to look at this [portion](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/first_look_at_the_editor.html) of the website where it displays all games
* This portion also shows the 3d versions, docks, symbols, folders, bottom panels, etc. 

### 10/28/2024:
* This week I am going to try out Godot by downloading or using this [website](https://godotengine.org/download/windows/)
* I also find this [website](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/index.html)
* After downloading it, I went back to the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKgTZWbwD1U&t=10s) and tried to follow it
* After getting to follow along with the tutorial, I found that Godot is really fun to use since you can interact with the objects and it seems so neat to use it
* We can be able to use code to program the movement of the user or the character
* The mesh component is useful for making solid shapes and adjusting the volume
* I have gotten to make this using the video:
* For the sun positioning I was confused about how to do the angling on the sunlight

* I circled the component that helped me and I found out that there are icons to make things more organized

* I enjoy using the platform, there are a lot of components on top of the icon
* I believe that the more I use this tool, I will get better at the workflow

### 11/4/2024 : BLOG 1

### 11/11/2024: 
* This week I plan to look at a document, watch a video, and try it
* For the document on the official website I wanted to look at this [page](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/02.player_input.html)
* This document is all about player scenes and inputting actions
* I already went through the player scenes last week but I don't mind having a recap of it
* Character bodies are complementary to the area and rigid bodies used in the 2D game tutorial. Like rigid bodies, they can move and collide with the environment, but instead of being controlled by the physics engine, you dictate their movement.
* Following the document
* It leads me to this:
![image](https://github.com/shellyw8542/apcsa-freedom-project/blob/main/Sphere.png)
* I finished creating my character and now it is time for me to do input actions
* I've realized that you do not need code to move the character by using the input map feature
* This is what I've gotten so far
![image](https://github.com/shellyw8542/apcsa-freedom-project/blob/main/Godot_Input_Map.png)
* For the next week, I will be continuing to follow the manual on the next document to help with my mini-game
