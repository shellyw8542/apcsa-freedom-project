### 9/30/2024: (Getting the gist of Godot)
* For my freedom Project I want to create a game using the tool of Godot
* Starting with the [website](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/introduction_to_godot.html), I read the introduction
* Godot has this community tutorial and resources for additional help and support --> [website](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/community/tutorials.html#doc-community-tutorials)
* Godot also has this screen which makes it organized and a lot like GitHub and Photoshop
* Godot has a component called Nodes
* Nodes are used to store things in the "tree"
* The tree is called a "scene tree" where it stores all the scenes in one place
* There is also a thing called signals that are used to change the code inside the tree. This is very useful and also flexible for some quick changes.

### 10/14/2024:
* This week I want to start looking at tutorials and I found two videos to take notes on
* Tutorial [one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKgTZWbwD1U&t=10s)
* I learned more about how Godot engine develops games
* Godot has a feature where you can alternate shapes to different sizes called Collision shapes
* Collision shapes are an amazing feature because you can adjust size by using your mouse
* There's also a thing called a Gizmo and it is there to make the shape adjustable for all sizes
* Mesh Instance is when you can make any shape 3d and also realistic with lighting
* The second [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntYjl_obUDo&list=PL9FzW-m48fn1iR6WL4mjXtGi8P4TaPIAp) shows me in a slower pace of what the first scene of Godot should look like
* Godot doesn't necessarily need code for a beginning scene, Godot can be used by dragging the mouse and creating new components.
* Godot feels a lot like HTML and CSS but more interactive instead of typing code
* Godot does have the option to write restrictions towards the game but at the moment I would be focusing on how the platform works

### 10/20/2024:
* This week I am just going to go through this [document](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/learning_new_features.html)
* This is called a user manual and it highlights the engine concepts
* There's a way to search up concepts as well using `F1` or searching up `Help`
* [This](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/index.html#doc-class-reference) is all the classes page
* This reference also tells you the class role and what goes through what  
For example: PhysicsBody2D --> Collision2D --> Node2D 
* There is also a community page where when people need help you can always ask for help
