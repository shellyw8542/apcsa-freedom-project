### 9/30/2024: (Getting the gist of Godot)
* For my freedom Project I want to create a game using the tool of Godot
* Starting with the [website](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/introduction_to_godot.html), I read the introduction
* Godot has this community tutorial and resources for additional help and support --> [website](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/community/tutorials.html#doc-community-tutorials)
* Godot also has this screen which makes it organized and a lot like GitHub and Photoshop
* Godot has a component called Nodes
* Nodes are used to store things in the "tree"
* The tree is called a "scene tree" where it stores all the scenes in one place
* There is also a thing called signals that are used to change the code inside the tree. This is very useful and also flexible for some quick changes.
