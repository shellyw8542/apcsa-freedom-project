# Entry 4
##### 3/17/2025

### Context
For this entry, I will be working with my MVP and contributing the information that I've learned from Godot to my freedom project.

### Working on the Freedom Project
I have gotten to work on the MVP timeline with my partner, assigning the date and who will do what.  
This is what the timeline would look like:

After finishing my MVP Timeline, I will follow it for the next few weeks. I collaborated a lot with my partner, we both created a wireframe of the layout for our project, we wanted to have trees and an enemy to fight as well as a forest and a place near a beach. This is what we agreed on for our layout:

Then we started working on the project itself, however, it took a while for us to set up the freedom project so that we could edit work together using Godot and Github.  I had a lot of difficulty setting it up but then I asked for help from my friend William. He recommended me to watch this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ-CJIYPFMI) to help set up the project and make it so that Angela can work with it. We downloaded Github on the desktop and had to link the files together. Then for the second week, I followed my MVP timeline and worked on creating the player and the movement for that player with `wasd` movements. I will be following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpF7wm0186Q&ab_channel=GDQuest) for movement, this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9ueeDIeJc8&ab_channel=ExploreGameDev) for how to implement the character model, and this [website](https://www.kenney.nl/assets?search=characters&sort=update) to find the character model that me and Angela would like to have. While following the implementing character model, I came across a problem. In the tutorial, you can just download and drag it onto Godot, but it didn't work out for me. I asked if Angela could do it but it also didn't work out for her either. After asking for help from my friend Dong, he told me that was a weird interaction and that maybe it might be better to go directly into the Godot file
