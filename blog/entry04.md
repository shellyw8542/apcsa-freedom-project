# Entry 4
##### 3/17/2025

### Context
For this entry, I will be working with my MVP and contributing the information that I've learned from Godot to my freedom project.

### Working on the Freedom Project
I have gotten to work on the MVP timeline with my partner, assigning the date and who will do what.  
This is what the timeline would look like:

After finishing my MVP Timeline, I will follow it for the next few weeks. I collaborated a lot with my partner, we both created a wireframe of the layout for our project, we wanted to have trees and an enemy to fight as well as a forest and a place near a beach. This is what we agreed on for our layout:
