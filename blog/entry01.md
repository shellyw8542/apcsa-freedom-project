### Context
I am writing this blog entry to explain the beginning process of my freedom project. I've decided to work with my good friend Angela on this project since we had similar interests and the tool we agreed on was the same. I wanted to work with Unity at first since there were a lot of games that used Unity that I played. Perhaps I wanted to make a game like it but one of my classmates said that Unity was outdated, so if I needed help on a topic or a component I couldn't get the help I needed. My interest was to create more of an open-world game where you can interact with "NPCs" and complete tasks and battle enemies.

### Learning Godot
I plan to learn how the website Godot works and the people's feedback on it. I wanted to watch tutorials, take notes, and start tinkering on the tool. I started learning by reading the [introduction](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/introduction_to_godot.html) and I've taken notes that Godot has a community and much additional support for coders with this [website and platforms](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/community/tutorials.html#doc-community-tutorials). I've also realized that the platform of Godot when you start to use it, it is a little like the platform of photoshop and also Github. Reading more about the components, I've seen this component called "Nodes", which nodes are the "branches" of the "tree". Nodes store things from the tree, and the tree is called a scene tree, where this feature holds all the scenes in one place. There is also a thing called signals that can make and find errors in a quick and timely matter. Then after reading the document, I watched two tutorials. The first [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKgTZWbwD1U&t=10s) explained how the Godot engine works and also helped explain `Collision shapes` and `Mesh Instance`. Collision shapes are a way to adjust the shape by using the mouse, and Mesh Instance is when you can create a 3D shape with realistic lighting components. The second [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntYjl_obUDo&list=PL9FzW-m48fn1iR6WL4mjXtGi8P4TaPIAp) shows me at a slower pace what the first scene of Godot should look like. It shows me that Godot doesn't need coding in the beginning and is more towards interactivity and then coding is for the programming movement. I feel that Godot is more like HTML and CSS but more interactive, Godot does have writing components but as for now, I plan to focus more on the platform and how it works. Going through a few more [documents](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/introduction/learning_new_features.html), it shows me that Godot has a user manual and it highlights the engine concepts and that there is a way to search for help by using `F1` or by searching up `Help`. [This](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/index.html#doc-class-reference) is all the classes page, it tells you the class roles and what they go through. For example: `PhysicsBody2D --> Collision2D --> Node2D`.
### Trying out the Tool
After downloading the tool, I went back to the [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKgTZWbwD1U&t=10s) and tried to follow it. Following the tutorial, I found that Godot is fun to use since you are interacting with the objects and changing the lighting of the scenery. I even got to be able to see the coding portion of Godot to help move my ball. I was able to use the Mesh Component to help make solid shapes and adjust the volume of the shapes, however, I was confused about how to get the correct angle. That is where I was able to look at the icons and start looking at what the engine has.  
Which in that case led me to this:

I was able to circle the component that helped me adjust the sunlight and I also created this ball:

I enjoy using this platform and I do believe that I would be hopefully getting better with the platform of it.
