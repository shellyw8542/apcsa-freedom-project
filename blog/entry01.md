### Context
I am writing this blog entry to explain the beginning process of my freedom project. I've decided to work with my good friend Angela on this project since we had similar interests and also the tool that we decided was the same. I wanted to work with Unity at first since there were a lot of games that used Unity that I played. Perhaps I wanted to make a game like it but one of my classmates said that Unity was outdated, so if I needed help on a topic or a component I couldn't get the help that I needed.
