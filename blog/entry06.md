# Entry 6
##### 6/2/25

### Context
In this blog, I will be explaining my in-class presentation and the expo pitch

### In-Class Presentations
This will be the last in-class presentation to showcase my freedom project. I kept thinking about all the moments in the past where I presented my freedom project, and how if I could do it last year, I could do it again this year and give it my all.
