### Context
In this blog, I will be explaining my in-class presentation and the expo pitch

### In-Class Presentations
This will be the last in-class presentation to showcase my freedom project. I kept thinking about all the moments in the past where I presented my freedom project, and how if I could do it last year, I could do it again this year and give it my all. I began to remember all the things that I did from my freedom project. The struggles that my partner and I faced were something that I wanted to talk about. My partner decided that she would like to talk about the project, struggles, and takeaways. While I would rather talk about the code and process of the components that made the project. I wanted to talk about the animation component, enemies, the death screen, and the scoreboard. After the presentation, I felt more relaxed since I’ve realized that I’m finished with my project, to be reflective, but also glad that I’ve achieved a lot within all 4 years in SEP. I congratulated my partner and received feedback to make more eye contact with the audience more often, but overall, I was happy with the results that came along the way. This is my [slideshow](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jl_BJqS9FOQr_QXS4s4OSuVKG_-N49fPfOmiAvXQs3U/edit?slide=id.p#slide=id.p) that I presented in class, and now it was time to prepare for the expo. 

### Expo Elevator-Pitch
Working on the elevator pitch was pretty simple. My partner decided that she wanted to show a live demo of how the project works: the health bar, how you can take damage when an enemy goes near it, the attacking animation, and the scoreboard. Within all of that, I wanted to present the enemy's code and how they can follow the player using the navigation agent component. The pitch was simpler than we expected, with the additional time we let the judges play our game, and it turned out to be relatively successful. After the judges went by, I glanced over to my partner, both realizing that we were done with our project and that we could enjoy the moment as we both knew that APCSA was finished. This is my script for my [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LQom_CwkakjxmgKW1A9g7RAu16lBKunOFo120D12BEw/edit?tab=t.0) on page 19.

### EDP and Takeaways
I am currently at the last step of the Engineering Design Process, where I am communicating the results. This is where I show off my project to other people. Explaining the struggle, how I overcame it, the purpose of the game, and the game’s functions and mechanics. A skill that I’ve learned from this blog is Communication. Communication helped me display my project, as well as include a small presentation explaining what should be said about my project. Communication also helped me collaborate more with my partner. It gave me an idea of who is presenting what, which also goes for the elevator pitch. Overall, I found this project rewarding and a reflective experience, as it reminded me of the past 3 years of the expo and the concept of the Freedom Project.
