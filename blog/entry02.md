### Context
I am writing this blog entry to explain my learning process on Godot. I've read, learned, and tinkered with my tool using multiple documents and trial and error. 
### Experimenting with the tools of Godot
At first, I wanted to follow documents to help create my "first 3D game". My first step in the manual was to have the player scene and actions. To do that I will need to follow the [manual](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/02.player_input.html), take notes, and apply it to Godot itself. Although I went to do player scenes in blog 1, I didn't mind recapping what happened and adding to the player's actions. Taking notes, I wrote that, Character bodies are complementary to the area and rigid bodies used in the 2D game tutorial. Like rigid bodies, they can move and collide with the environment, but instead of being controlled by the physics engine, you dictate their movement. Characters are objects that can move in command of the user and that they can collide with the surface and things that surround the character.  
By doing some tinkering, I've gotten up to this part of the scene:

This is the formatting of my character and now my next goal is to try to input actions and movement. While trying to work with the interactive platform, I realized that you did not need to know how to code with the movement just yet, but rather you can use this portion of the platform called the "Input Map" which when you press a key bind, the character moves on whatever the coder writes. 
This leading to what I have here:
